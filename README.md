## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a company with several thousand loyal employees; many of which are baby-boomers about to retire.  This mass retirement coming up has been termed the "silver tsunami".  Bobby, the Pewlett-Hackard HR analyst, was tasked to perform employee research with my assistance and analyze data to answer the following:

- ***Who will be retiring in the next few years, and what are their current titles?***
- ***Which employees are eligible for a mentorship program?***

Data is currently pulled into csv files from seperate systems, but needs to be built into a database for future use and scalability.  SQL is the preferred database structure.

We have been provided six CSV files (listed below in resources) to convert into the SQL database for the retirement analysis.  Based on the csv files, we created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) to plan out our data relationships and start our SQL query.

## Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title:

- We started by creating a table of those of retirement age and their titles.  To do so, we linked the employees csv file with the titles csv file in a left join respectively using the employee numbers.  We grabbed the employee number, first name and last name from the employees csv and the title, from date and to date from the titles csv.  This table was saved as [retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/catsdata/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv) with 133,776 results.  The results contained duplicate employees due to job changes as well as employees no longer with Pewlett-Hackard.

- To remove duplicates, we used DISTINCT ON with the employee number.  We then removed ex-employees by adding in a WHERE clause that had the "9999-01-01" default to_date for active employees.  This reduced us to 72,458 records, removing over 90,000 rows of data for duplicates and ex-employees.  Revised data was saved to [unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/catsdata/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/unique_titles.csv).

- To summarize the data by titles, we selected counts into new file [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/catsdata/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv).

### Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program:

- Pewlett-Hackard execs wanted to look into a Mentorship program for new employees coming in to replace the retirees.  It was requested to find employeees born in 1965.  Using DISTINCT ON again from the employee numbers, we grabbed data from the employees csv file, dept_emp csv file, and titles csv file.  All contained the employee numbers.  Data was filtered with birthdates from 1965-01-01 to 1965-12-31 and to grab only active employees the to_date filtered to 9999-01-01.  Data was saved into [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/catsdata/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv).  1549 employees were listed.

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

   The list of possible mentors was limited to just birth year and active status.  But that doesn't mean those individuals are qualified.  Someone who has just recently started a position would not be qualified to mentor as they're still learning themselves.  It should also not be limited to age other than not being too close to retirement age themselves as they wouldn't be available to mentor for long.   To make the mentor list more robust, we changed the 1965 birth year to any birthdate after 1965-01-01.  We also filtered that the employee has been in their current position for more than two years with a from date older than 2000-08-01.  It was here we discovered we only have employees born before 1965-02-01 and that we don't have a full list of employees from our original sources.  If we go based on what we have, we narrowed down to only 145 qualified mentors to help train 72,458 possible incoming employees.  Data was saved in [mentorship_revised.csv](https://github.com/catsdata/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_revised.csv).  145 is definitely not enough mentors; and does not cover all positions.  We need more complete raw data to revise our expectations.
